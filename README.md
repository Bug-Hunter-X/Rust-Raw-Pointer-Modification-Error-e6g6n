This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: modifying data through a raw pointer without proper precautions.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a safe alternative using the proper Rust mechanisms.  This demonstrates the importance of understanding memory management and safe Rust practices when working with pointers.
